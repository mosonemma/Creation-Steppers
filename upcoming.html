                    <h2>5th January – Kanyangareng River Carnival</h2>
                    <p>Kanyangareng River Carnival is an annual event of organized series of edutainment which entails, carrier guidance, plays, or films, Creative displays held every 5th of January at the banks of river Kanyangareng in Amudat Town Council Amudat district of Uganda.</p>
                    <p>This River Carnival started on the 5th of January 2017 by a group of Creation Steppers youth enjoying their holiday, it however later started attracting the attention of the entire community especially the young people. The founding members saw this as an opportunity to unite and empower Amudat youth especially the youth both in and out of school and advocate against bad cultural practices. The activity is coordinated by Creation Steppers and implemented regionally by Warrior Promotions and Jedark Home of Creativity with support from the community.</p>                    
                    <p>This Carnival has become more popular over the years and attracts more participants which require more resources, effort and creativity from different to enable achievement of the desired event objectives.</p>
                    <p>Unlike in other areas of Karamoja, the population in Amudat does not regard dialogue meetings as a big deal most especially when no transport refund is provided. It’s upon this background that we decided to change the festival organization inviting stake holders from different departments who engage the youth along with other indulging educational and recreational activities making the event effective and efficient.</p>
                    <p>This Carnival will benefit from the Foundation’s experience of strengthening civil society’s capacity to engage with governments and other development partners to promote desired aspects of the sustainable development goals in health, economic empowerment livelihood good governance, culture and diversity.</p>

                    <h2>June/ July – Creation Steppers Excursion</h2>
                    <p>This is an educational tour aiming to broaden the minds of the youth by exposing them to productive sectors such as agriculture, industry, and tourism. Through this, we hope to inspire innovation, entrepreneurship, and responsible citizenship among participants.</p>
                    <p>Given the fact that we are in a setup of an area that illiteracy rate is high and low exposure amongst community members, the upcoming generation especially the ones born and studding around Amudat District would never have a chance to visit and learn more beyond home practices, we therefore thought it wise to have an excursion that will give other youth chance to exposure.</p>
